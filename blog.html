      There’s a lot to learn at Trek University so we’ve broken it down into a few manageable chunks. We start with seven schools and then break those into different subjects. If you complete a school you have the opportunity to download a diploma to show off to your friends or prove to your boss that you know your stuff. Here’s how it breaks out:


      Finish all the modules in any of these 5 areas of knowledge and receive your diploma.

      <ul>
        <li>Road = Road Scholar Diploma</li>
        <li>Mountain = Dirt Scientist Diploma</li>
        <li>City = City Savant Diploma</li>
        <li>Bontrager = Bontrager Philosopher Diploma</li>
        <li>Retail = Retail Virtuoso Diploma</li>
      </ul>
Remember, from time to time when you earn a diploma (or reach other such milestones) you’ll have the opportunity for a great deal on bikes or frames that you can’t get anywhere else. So read your email and keep up to date on the news section of Trek University!
